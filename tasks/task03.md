#### 1. Prove that we get the max eff point for the x y value given we don't give the max point in the dataset.
   - just vary the Rload value and find eff
   - eff for point beyond the data and also not in dataset.
   - Rload vs Power

#### 2. Eagle *eda* course complete, net, layout, routing name and component creation.
#### 3. Check the switching losses.
#### 4. Download CCS V12, control suite.
#### 5. Eagle PCB Model -- 2 varients.
#### 6. Documentation of ML
#### 7. Paper for Calculating Switching & Conduction Losses in Power Semiconductors for Circuit Simulations.
