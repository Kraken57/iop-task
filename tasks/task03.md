1. [ ] Prove that we get the max eff point for the x y value given we don't give the max point in the dataset.
   - just vary the Rload value and find eff
   - eff for point beyond the data and also not in dataset.
   - Rload vs Power

2. [X] Eagle *eda* course complete, net, layout, routing name and component creation.
3. [X] Check the switching losses.
4. [X] Download CCS V12, control suite.
5. [ ] Eagle PCB Model -- 2 varients.
6. [X] Documentation of ML
7. [X] Paper for Calculating Switching & Conduction Losses in Power Semiconductors for Circuit Simulations.
