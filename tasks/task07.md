# IOP (MID EVAL TASKS) - 20 March 2025

###  Presentation

- TO DO :
    - 1st page diagrams - explain
    - hardware explanation
    - spwm - *(know about it how it is generated etc)*
    - work on machine learning *(normal and RL)*
    - approaches we did - *(like the MATLAB model)*
        - then mention about, each like one page
        - mention on what work you did
    - pcb how you selected gate driver, components etc.
    - switching loss - don't go into the details
    - Timeline
    - bom *(bill of material)*
    - future task
    - diagrams
    - references 
    - overleaf report - *(latex)*
    - if done any mistake mention that and explain the improved method.
    
    ---
- Questions : 
    - what h-bridge do , why you used it, how to apply pulses to it ?
    - how to apply spwm , signal, gate driver, what kind of output you expect
    - what is the need of going to ml based method as spwm etc are too popular.


- ### About Report
    - Report
        - order same as presentation
        - more theoritical
        - spwm output result 
        - boundary condition for the ml
        - two convertor should be shorted
        - etc ....

### Show

- dsp model , code of spwm in ccs
- presentation
- report 
- pcb design

### Miscellaneous
- Time line ka kuch mention kiya tha
