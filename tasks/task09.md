1. pcb + controller -> hbridge working
2. ML assisted modulation not exactly MPC
    - whether it makes sense.
    - surgery related loads could matter
3. come up with some examples that makes sense to MPC method
4. spwm work -- do on Monday
5. Proof of the MPC thing to explain (unbalanced thing)
6. some application of power electronic system where there are n number of variable which make sense to use MPC architecture.
    - EV related example,........
7. hyperopt or optuna 
8. histogram of training dataset
9. supervised vs RL training dataset bias compare 
10. write the code of ML in C.
11. discussion of RL and Supervised.
12. Read about examples to correlate.
13. DC link capacitor in PCB.
14. Model is overfitting ------ 70 10 20 ---- 10 validation loss.
15. PCB finishhhhhhh on Monday 3 pm
