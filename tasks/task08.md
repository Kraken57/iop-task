## Report Error - 21 March 2025

 - Fig 1 - diagram
 - Fig 2 - label - x and y are not visible 
 - equation -- label eq 1
 - fig 3 - number --> mention the no. avg value...
 - abstract --> this report

 - change proposed to implemented
 - fig 4 --- justify -- also the original output

 - draw figure for the explanation so that by seeing it they get everything --- some block diagram approach

 - why are you computing switching losses ?
 - bhai wo jo smjhaya dekh lena -- what ml will do in addition with spwm ...

 - Acknowledgement remove
 - fig ke liye full form
 - table caption on top
 - explain why are you calculating THD and switching loss
 - if can compare balle balle
 - name at top same krna 

 - Study and Evaluation of Machine Learning-based Control for  H-bridge Inverter

 - how to put publication level fig in paper
 - border not visible - box hta dena
 - eps or pdf in matlab
 - never write subsection immediately after section 
 - equations me space bhut h 
 - write about the figure below it
 - thd kiska nikala h - current ya voltage
 - use shorter subscript
 - figure ko sharp blue
 - write about the mathematical interpretation of the figure.
 - dc ka magnitude bhi aa rha h fig 2 -- starting me kuch dc transient aa rha h bcz RL load h .
 - time constant L/R for RL component. 
 
 - summarize
    - meaning
    - images clear



- for future how would you check the switching loss in hardware
